While the availability of georeferenced data is increasing, particularly for
urban environments, extracting insight from this data is still a challenging
task, especially when dealing with historical data to find patterns of temporal
evolution. In this context, the data is usually gathered in different ways for
each temporal step: variables are added, removed, or redefined; geographical
regions changed; different variables measured using different regions.

This problem is usually approached via an harmonisation process, where the data
is interpolated to an arbitrary set of geographical regions and different
variables are mapped into time series. This process is time-consuming and
error-prone, and limited to periods where compatible variables are available,
which can hinder a more comprehensive analysis.

In this work we propose a method to discover patterns of temporal changes
considering all the available data, in its original format, without
harmonisations or interpolations. Since comparisons between different temporal
step are not directly possible, this approach assumes a certain level of
stability across time, similar regions are more likely to remain similar in the
near temporal steps.
